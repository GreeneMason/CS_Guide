## Binary Search
Check the element in the middle of the interval, determine if it is too high or too low and then discard the half of the interval that is the opposite direction of the search paramater. 
Then repeat until the middle element is equal to the search parameter

log n

## Insertion Sort
As you go through the elements you compare to the previous element and if they are not in order then insert the element to a spot that it is in order. (Like you would with a hand of cards)

## Merge Sort
Divide the problem into independent parts and then merge all of the answers together once all the independent problems are solved.

n log n

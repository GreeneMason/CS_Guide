### Linked list
A data structure that has two pieces of data per node, the first being the contents of the node and the second being a pointer to the next element in the list of linked nodes. 

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
The node at the top of the BST is the root node.

The node to the left is a left subtree and the node to the right is a right sub tree.

If a node has no left or right subtree it is a leaf node. 

To search
- First check if root is empty
- Check if root is a match
- Check if the root key is smaller than the search key, if so search recurively left.
- Check if the root key is larger than the search key, if so search recursively right.

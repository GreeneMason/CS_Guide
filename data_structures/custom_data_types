# Data types/Object oriented proramming
Bespoke abstract data types developed for a specific task or library. Used like you would use a String or int. 

### Object references
Constructors create objects and return the reference for said object to the client. 

### Checklist
- The class with custom data types is in the same directory
- The syntax is custom_data variable_name = arguement/declaration;
- The method is a compatible static or an instance method with the client side code

# Recursion

Definition; [Recursion](recursion.md)

### Induction
Induction is recursion but its called induction when you use it in math to prove something works with alot of different inputs.

### Base case
This is the key to stopping the infinite loop, basically its a condition to stop the recursion process. 

### Down sides
 - Hard on memory
 - Sometimes the problem can grow larger rather than smaller
 - Lots of repetition (without memoization)
 - Exponential big O

### Dynamic programming
The practice of taking large complex tasks/problems and breaking them down into smaller more manageable tasks.  
Then using those answes to avoid repeating the same computations and avoid exponential complexity.

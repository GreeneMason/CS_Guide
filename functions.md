# Functions  
*whenever you can clearly separate tasks within  programs, you should do so.*  

Static; Static methods are functions that belong to the whole class. A static method does not need an instance for the static method to work.   

## Definitons
Control Flow; When you call a method or function you are transfering the control over to said function until its operations are complete and then the code picks up where it left off.   
Overloading; This is when you give two different methods the same name but different return values, this way you can pass one argument and depending on the argument one of the two will run.  
Scope; Any part of the program that can refer to a variable by name is within the scope of said variable.  
Side effects; This is when you call on a function that isn't returning back with a return value it is just a "tool" to do some side function before continuing on with the primary function.  
Public; Means the function is available for use for any function with the functions file.   


*IF YOU THINK OF EACH PROGRAM that you write as something that you might want to  make use of later, you will soon find yourself with all sorts of useful tools.*

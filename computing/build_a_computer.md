### Boolean logic
Wether it is a 1 and 0 binary system or true and false, a boolean data type is the building block of modern computers.

Some boolean functions:
NOT(x)
AND(x,y)
OR(x,y)
XOR(x,y)

### Basic Curcuitry
Wires, Power Source, and Controlled Switches

"A circuit is an interconnected network of wires, power connections, and controlled switches that transforms values on input wires to values on output wires."
Sedgewick, Robert; Wayne, Kevin. Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (p. 1002).

Wires: The wires connect to wires, power sources, and controlled switches.
Controlled Switches: The places in a circuit where  a switch controlled line crosses another wire and then ends which causes a change in the value. 
Curcuit: A connection of circuit inputs to switch control lines and switch outputs to other switch control lines/circuit outputs.

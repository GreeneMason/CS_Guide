Machine level programming: sets of value and operations on those values. 

### Memory
Holds the data being processed, the program being ran, and the results of the computation. 

### Registar
A machine component that holds a sequence of bits, the intermeddiate results to be used throughout the program. 
TOY machine has 16 registars, numbered 0-F

### Arithmetic logic unit 
Typically is given two registars and uses one registar as the result. Computes a stored arithmetic operation on the inputs. 

### Program counter 
Internal registar that holds the address of the next operation to be completed.

### Instuction registar
The registar that contains the current operation to be computed.

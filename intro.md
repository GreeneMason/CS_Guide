# Introduction to Computer Science w/ Java
This section will be about simply getting code to compile and run.

## Excecutable code checklist
 - The correct file extension (ei. .java or .py)
 - Correct formatting, .class extension has correct syntax
 - Dependencies, the appropriate compilers or interpreters are downloaded
 - No syntax or spelling errors

## Definitons 
__Literals;__ The content of any give data type, for example the true or false for boolean or the number 8 for an integer.
__Operators;__ Actions for the data types, each data type has specific access to certain actions. For example int and double can use '+' operation but a boolean would not. 
__Identifiers;__ Names of vairiable, classes, or anything you need to name but the for java the first letter cant be a number.
__CONSTANT_VARIABLES;__ Variables that are always the same within their scope, always with all caps identifiers. 
__Expression;__ A line of code that is able to produce an output using literals, variables, and operations.


## Java's built in datatypes
 - int (integers)
 - double (real numbers)
 - boolean (true or false)
 - String (sequence of characters)
 - char (characters)

## Comparisons
 - == equals
 - <= less than or equal 
 - >= greater than or equal
 - > greater than
 - < less than
 - != not equals

##  Libraries
Example; Math.random()   Math is the library   random is a function within Math
Syntax; Library.function(argument)

# Libraries

Classes that contain a set of releated methods for other classes or programs to access. 

## Definitions
Clients; A program that calls on a library, the program that calls on the library is the client program.  
API; A "contract" for the client and a clear implementation.  
Implementation; Java code that uses methods from an API.  

### Unit Testing

It is considered good practice to have a unit test for all public and essential methods/functions.  
There's many ways to test your code but no method is a one size fits all. Testing itself can be a challenge and just because you pass all your tests does not mean the code is actually "fool-proof".  
The idea is to use it for debugging and for some sort of assurance that your code wont implode on itself.

Basically there is no such thing as true random in computer science, there is always an underlaying protocol or pattern.

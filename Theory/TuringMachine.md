## Turing Machine Model
- A finite number of states, each of wich is a left, right, or halt state
- A set of transitions that specify which state is next and which symbol to write
- A tape that holds strings of symbols 
- A tape heap capable of reading or writing a symbol and traversing the tape to read/write the next symbol

Compact Trace format -  a compact illustration of the TM 

State-Table representation - a table to show each step and what states are changing from step to step

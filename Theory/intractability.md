### Main idea
To seperate problems that take exponential time from problem that take polynomial time. 

### Polynomial time algorithms
An algorithm with a running time as a function of the input size bounded above by a * n^b for all inputs where a and b are postive constants.

### Exponential time algorithm
An algorithm with a running time as a function of the input bounded below by 2^(a*n^(b))

### Satisfiability
- Linear equation satisfiability - Given a set of n linear equations involving n  variables, find an assignment of rational values to the variables that satisfies  all of the equations, or report that none exists. 
- Linear inequality satisfiability - Given a set of m linear inequalities involving  n variables, find an assignment of rational values to the variables that satis-  fies all of the inequalities, or report that none exists. 
- Integer linear inequality satisfiability - Given a set of m linear inequalities  involving n variables, find an assignment of integer values to the variables  that satisfies all of the inequalities, or report that none exists.
- Boolean satisfiability - Given a set of m equations involving n boolean variables, find an assignment of boolean values to the variables that satisfies all  of the equations, or report that none exists. 

### Search problems
A search problem is a problem whose solutions have the  property that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that can check  whether a given solution solves a given instance of the problem.
